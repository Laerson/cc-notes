Ways of getting Kubernetes:

	1. K8s playgrounds: Play with Kubernetes, Katacoda, Docker Dekstop, minikube, etc
		NOT FOR PRODUCTION

	2. Hosted Kubernetes:
		Outsource the infra to the cloud provider
		examples:
			GKE, AWS, Azure, DOKS, LKE

	3. DIY install

kubectl:
	main kubernetes CLI tool
	use always at least a version that's no more that one minor version higher or lower than the cluster

	It converts user-friendly commands into HTTP REST requests with JSON content
	The configuration file called 'config' is inside the directory $HOME/.kube/config
	We call the config file with kubeconfig
