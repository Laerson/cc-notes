Containers

Container is a runtime instance of an image

To run a container:
	docker run <image>
	or
	docker container run <image>

	e.g.:
	docker container run -it <image> /bin/bash

docker container stop
docker container start
docker container rm
--name (this flag lets you choose a name for the container)
-d (instead of -it. It makes the image run on background, or "daemon mode")
-p <host-port:container-port>

serveless: back-end is highly virtualized to the point of host or node having no meaning

The main difference between VMs and Containers is that
	-Vms virtualize hardware
	-Containers virtualize OS


Data is persistent in the container, however:
	1. It is stored on the host local fs
	2. containers are designed to be immutable
Therefore, it is not a good idea to use the container as persistent file storage, you should use VOLUMES.

Volumes exist separately from the container but can be mounted into the container at runtime

Self-healing containers
	It is a good idea to run containers with a restart policy
	they can be configured on CLI (--restart <policy>) or with YAML files

	the following policies exit:
		always
		unless-stopped
		on-failed

	always: always restart a stopped container, unless it has been explicitily stopped
	unless-stopped: Won't start if the daemon is restarted
	on-failed: Restarts containers that exits with non-zero exit code
