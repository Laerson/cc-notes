Getting images onto Docker host is called "pulling"
docker pull `imagename`
e.g. `docker pull ubuntu:latest`

To launch a container, use `docker run`
e.g. `docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
the `-it` flag tells Docker to make the container interactive, and to attach the current shell to the container
The image argument tells which image the container should be based of
the `/bin/bash` is the process we want to run inside the container

Ctrl-pq to leave the container without killing it

`docker ps` shows the running containers

To attach the shell to a running container:
	docker container exec
	e.g.:
		docker container exec -it <container name or ID> <app>
		<app> can be bash, for example

To stop and kill a container:
	docker stop <container>
	docker rm <container>


# 
From a repository with a Dockerfile, we can build the image with:
`docker image build`

eg:
`docker image build -t test:latest` .

`docker image ls`
shows all the images in the host

to run the image:
`docker container run -d --name <name of the container> --publish <port:port> <image>
