Three layers of Docker tech:
	1. Runtime
	2. The daemon
	3. Orchestrator

Runtime:
	lower level
	starts and stop containers
	made of two levels: runc, and containerd
	runc is low level, one for each instance
	containerd is highlevel, manages the entrire lifecycle of a container. One for each docker installation.

Daemon:
	Above runtime level
	Performs higher level tasks (expose the docker remotes API, manage images, managing volumes, networks, etc)
	Provides an easy to use interface to the lower level abstraction
