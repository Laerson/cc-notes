Motivation:
	Old days: one application per server
		Business had to buy a new server for new applications
		They couldn't test performance requirements, so they ended up buying overpowered servers = waste of money

	VMware:
		Now Business could run multiple apps securely in one server
		However, each VM requires an OS (that consumes computer resources)
		VMs are slow to boot
		Not so portable
	
	Containers:
		Analogous to a VM, but don't require a full OS
