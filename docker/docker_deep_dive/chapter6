Images

A docker image is a package that contains everything required for an application to run
If you have an app`s docker image, you only need a computer running Docker

You get docker images by PULLING them from an image registry (Docker Hub, gitlab registry, github registry, etc)
pull - downloads the image from the repository

image = build time
container = runtime


to pull image:
docker pull <image:tag>

filter the output of `docker image ls`:
	docker image ls --filter (dangling | before | since | label)

check the details of a image (including layers)
	docker image inspect <image:tag>

to remove a image:
	docker rm <image>
