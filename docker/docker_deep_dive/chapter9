Docker Compose

Modern cloud-native apps are made of multiple smaller services that interact to form a useful app.

We call that microservices

Docker compose is does the deployment and management of those services
Describe the entire app in a single declarative conf file, and deploy with a single command

Compose Files:
	YAML files
	default name: docker-compose.yml
	4 top-level keys":
		. version
			version of the Compose file
			should normally use the latest
		. services
			Define the different microservices of the app
			Each service will be deployed to a different container
		. networks
			Tells docker to create new networks
			by default compose create `bridge` networks
				bridge are single-host networks, that only connect containers on same host
		. volumes
	There are other


`docker-compose up` is the most common way to bring up a Compose app
-f filepath
-d brings the app to the background

App management:
	docker-compose down
	volumes are not deleted (they are mean to be persistent storage)
	docker-compose stop
	does not remove the app definition from the system
